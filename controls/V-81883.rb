  title "MongoDB must protect the confidentiality and integrity of all
  information at rest."
  desc "This control is intended to address the confidentiality and integrity
  of information at rest in non-mobile devices and covers user information and
  system information. Information at rest refers to the state of information when
  it is located on a secondary storage device (e.g., disk drive, tape drive)
  within an organizational information system. Applications and application users
  generate information throughout the course of their application use.

      User data generated, as well as application-specific configuration data,
  needs to be protected. Organizations may choose to employ different mechanisms
  to achieve confidentiality and integrity protections, as appropriate.

      If the confidentiality and integrity of application data is not protected,
  the data will be open to compromise and unauthorized modification.

  that the \"security.enableEncryption\" option is set to \"true\" in the MongoDB
  configuration file (default location: /etc/mongod.conf) or that MongoDB was

  Check the MongoDB configuration file (default location: /etc/mongod.conf).
