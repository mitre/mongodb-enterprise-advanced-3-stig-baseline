  title 'MongoDB must protect its audit features from unauthorized access.'
  desc "Protecting audit data also includes identifying and protecting the
  tools used to view and manipulate log data.

      Depending upon the log format and application, system and application log
  tools may provide the only means to manipulate and manage application and
  system log data. It is, therefore, imperative that access to audit tools be
  controlled and protected from unauthorized access.

      Applications providing tools to interface with audit data will leverage
  user permissions and roles identifying the user accessing the tools and the
  corresponding rights the user enjoys in order make access decisions regarding
  the access to audit tools.

      Audit tools include, but are not limited to, OS-provided audit tools,
  vendor-provided audit tools, and open source audit tools needed to successfully
  view and manipulate audit information system activity and records.

      If an attacker were to gain access to audit tools, he could analyze audit
  logs for system weaknesses or weaknesses in the auditing itself. An attacker
  could also manipulate logs to hide evidence of malicious activity.
