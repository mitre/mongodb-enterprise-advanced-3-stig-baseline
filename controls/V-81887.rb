  encrypted representations of information, produced by the actions of a prior
  user/role (or the actions of a process acting on behalf of a prior user/role)
  from being available to any current user/role (or current process) that obtains
  access to a shared system resource (e.g., registers, main memory, secondary
  storage) after the resource has been released back to the information system.
  Control of information in shared resources is also referred to as object reuse.
