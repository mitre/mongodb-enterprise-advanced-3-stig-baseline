  desc "fix", "If MongoDB is configured to authenticate using SASL and
  LDAP/Active Directory modify and restart the saslauthd command line options in
  the system boot script and set the \"-t\" option to the appropriate timeout in

  From the Linux Command line (with root/sudo privs) run the following command to
  restart the saslauthd process after making the change for the \"-t\" parameter:
  systemctl restart saslauthd
  If any mongos process is running (a MongoDB shared cluster) the
  \"userCacheInvalidationIntervalSecs\" option to adjust the timeout in seconds
  can be changed from the default \"30\" seconds.
  This is accomplished by modifying the mongos configuration file (default
  location: /etc/mongod.conf) and then restarting mongos.
  
  In the mongod.conf, set timeoutMS to 1000.
  security:
  ldap:
  timeoutMS: 1000
  
  In the saslauthd file ( default location: /etc/sysconfig/saslauthd ), set FLAGS to -t 900
  FLAGS= -t 900
  
  Also, in the saslauthd file, set MECH to ldap
